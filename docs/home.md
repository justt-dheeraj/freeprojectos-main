## home.py

home.py handles the main part of FREEProjectOS.

When using FREEProjectOS this is where you will spend most of your time.

home.py pretty much includes all the options to interact with the OS.

If you want to configure home.py I recommend you check out the document "Kernel"

Otherwise lets talk about the BioS.

Yes I know weird the BioS system is built right
into home.py

The BioS includes information like changing passwords, usernames
hostip, hostname of the PC. So it will prompt you to
enter your password for your account.
