FREEProjectOS is a free and open source reliable python operating system.

It was made to help make computing easier and faster!

How does FREEProjectOS work exactly?

Since FREEProjectOS is running on top of a high level language
that is python it needs to rely on a HostOS like windows.

Since python is a high level language meaning its very abstracted from
working with the computer compared to something low level like assembly
it lets windows handles the low level part for us. making FREEProjectOS 
even easier to install.
