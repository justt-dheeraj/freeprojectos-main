## Install documentation

First of all you need a copy of 
FREEProjectOS of course.

You can obtain one by cloning the repo
or directly downloading the source code
or just get it from the releases tab.

Since FREEProjectOS runs off python.
You are gonna need python as well (python 3 otherwise don't be surprised when something doesn't work)

Once you got your copy

Run "buildOS.bat"
This will install all the required
packages for running FREEProjectOS.

Once Done
run "startOS.bat"
then enjoy FREEProjectOS!

## Credits

The name "FREEProjectOS" came from here: https://freeproject-oss.github.io/os.html
That is NOT mine. Sadly that version of FREEProjectOS is discontinued and outdated.
So I decided to take the name for my operating system. if the developer wants me to change
the name I will gladly do so.
